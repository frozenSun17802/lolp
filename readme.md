# Markdown Open Link

This is a vim plugin to open links in markdown files. This
script adds a function called 'mdopenlink#OpenLink' which
open in a new buffer the file that is contained within the
link brackets. This file needs to be a local file relative
to the working path within vim. You can bind the function
to any binding you desire.

## TODO

Some features I would like to add:
+ Support opening links in the web browser
  if link is a URL
+ Add features to navigate around a markdown
  file, such as jumping around a table of contents
